Made a physical prototype of the ramp and decided it will move along the two doodads kind of like a shelf.
we know the shelf wil have to eventually be fastened to the doodads, otherwise it will slide off.
no matter our solution to the slide off problem we need to create doodads that move up and down along with player input.
the first step is to just make one doodads that moves up and down with player input
## what buttoms will be used?
we know we are developing on mouse and keyboard so no matter what platform we ultimatelt release the on pc ,xbox etc we have to have keyboard controls so that we can test the game develop it on pc
commonly games use WASD, or the arrown keys so we could use
another option could be up and down arrow on keybaord left right click on mouse
